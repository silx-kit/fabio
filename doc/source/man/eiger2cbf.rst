Eiger2CBF
=========

Purpose
-------

Convert a multiframe HDF5 Eiger data file into several CBF files.

Portable image converter based on FabIO library to export Eiger frames (``lima`` or ``eiger``)
to CBF which mimic the header of a Dectris Pilatus detector.

Usage:
------

eiger2cbf [-h] [-V] [-v] [-\-debug] [-o OUTPUT] [-m MASK] [-O OFFSET] [-D DUMMY] [-\-pilatus] [-\-dry-run] [-e ENERGY]
[-w WAVELENGTH] [-d DISTANCE] [-b BEAM BEAM] [-\-alpha ALPHA] [-\-kappa KAPPA] [-\-chi CHI] [-\-phi PHI]
[-\-omega OMEGA] [-\-rotation ROTATION] [-\-transpose] [-\-flip-ud] [-\-flip-lr]
[IMAGE ...]

Positional arguments:
+++++++++++++++++++++

IMAGE
   File with input images

Options:
++++++++

**-h**, **-\-help**
   show this help message and exit

**-V**, **-\-version**
   output version and exit

**-v**, **-\-verbose**
   show information for each conversions

**-\-debug**
   show debug information

Main arguments:
+++++++++++++++

**-o** OUTPUT, **-\-output** OUTPUT
   output directory and filename template:
   ``eiger2cbf/frame_{index:04d}.cbf``

**-m** MASK, **-\-mask** MASK
   Read masked pixel from this file

**-O** OFFSET, **-\-offset** OFFSET
   index offset, CrysalisPro likes indexes to start at 1,
   Python starts at 0 (default)

**-D** DUMMY, **-\-dummy** DUMMY
   Set masked values to this dummy value

**-\-pilatus**
   Select an image shape similar to Pilatus detectors for compatibiliy
   with Crysalis

Optional behaviour arguments:
+++++++++++++++++++++++++++++

**-\-dry-run**
   do everything except modifying the file system

Experimental setup options:
+++++++++++++++++++++++++++

**-e** ENERGY, **-\-energy** ENERGY
   Energy of the incident beam in keV

**-w** WAVELENGTH, **-\-wavelength** WAVELENGTH
   Wavelength of the incident beam in Angstrom

**-d** DISTANCE, **-\-distance** DISTANCE
   Detector distance in meters

**-b** BEAM BEAM, **-\-beam** BEAM BEAM
   Direct beam in pixels x, y

Goniometer setup:
-----------------

**-\-alpha** ALPHA
   Goniometer angle alpha value in deg.
   Constant, angle between kappa and omega.

**-\-kappa** KAPPA
   Goniometer angle kappa value in degrees or formula f(index)
   ``-80 + 2*index``

**-\-chi** CHI
   Goniometer angle chi value in degres or formula f(index)

**-\-phi** PHI
   Goniometer angle phi value (inner-most rotation) in degrees or formula f(index)
   ``-180+0.7*index``

**-\-omega** OMEGA
   Goniometer angle omega value (outer-most rotation) in degrees or formula f(index)
   ``-180+0.5*index``

Image preprocessing:
++++++++++++++++++++

Images are patched onto the center of a square frame, and transformation are applied in this order:

**-\-rotation** ROTATION
   Rotate the initial image by this value in degrees. Must be a multiple
   of 90 degrees.

**-\-transpose**
   Flip the x/y axis

**-\-flip-ud**
   Flip the image upside-down

**-\-flip-lr**
   Flip the image left-right

Return code:
++++++++++++

- 0 means a success.
- 1 means the conversion contains a failure,
- 2 means there was an error in the arguments

Nota:
-----

Images are made square, so the beam center found in the CBF-files differs from the one entered.
