<h1>Getting Started<a class="headerlink" href="#getting-started" title="Permalink to this headline">¶</a></h1>
<p>FabIO is a Python module for reading and handling data from two-dimensional X-ray
detectors.</p>
<p>FabIO is a Python module written for easy and transparent reading
of raw two-dimensional data from various X-ray detectors. The
module provides a function for reading any image and returning a
FabioImage object which contains both metadata (header information)
and the raw data. All FabioImage object offer additional methods to
extract information about the image and to open other detector
images from the same data series.</p>
<div class="section" id="introduction">
<h2>Introduction<a class="headerlink" href="#introduction" title="Permalink to this headline">¶</a></h2>
<p>One obstacle when writing software to analyse data collected from a
two-dimensional detector is to read the raw data into the program,
not least because the data can be stored in many different formats
depending on the instrument used. To overcome this problem we
decided to develop a general module, FabIO (FABle I/O), to handle
reading and writing of two-dimensional data. The code-base was
initiated by merging parts of our fabian imageviewer and
ImageD11 peak-search programs and has been developed
since 2007 as part of the TotalCryst program suite for
analysis of 3DXRD microscopy data. During integration into
a range of scientific programs like the FABLE graphical interface,
EDNA and the fast azimuthal integration library,
pyFAI; FabIO has gained several features like handling
multi-frame image formats as well as writing many of the file
formats.</p>
</div>
<div class="section" id="fabio-python-module">
<h2>FabIO Python module<a class="headerlink" href="#fabio-python-module" title="Permalink to this headline">¶</a></h2>
<p>Python is a scripting language that is very popular among
scientists and which also allows well structured applications and
libraries to be developed.</p>
<div class="section" id="philosophy">
<h3>Philosophy<a class="headerlink" href="#philosophy" title="Permalink to this headline">¶</a></h3>
<p>The intention behind this development was to create a Python module
which would enable easy reading of 2D data images, from any
detector without having to worry about the file format. Therefore
FabIO just needs a file name to open a file and it determines the
file format automatically and deals with gzip and bzip2
compression transparently. Opening a file returns an object
which stores the image in memory as a 2D NumPy array
and the metadata, called header, in a Python dictionary.
Beside the data and header attributes, some methods are
provided for reading the previous or next image in a series of
images as well as jumping to a specific file number. For the user,
these auxiliary methods are intended to be independent of the image
format (as far as is reasonably possible).</p>
<p>FabIO is written in an object-oriented style (with classes) but
aims at being used in a scripting environment: special care has
been taken to ensure the library remains easy to use. Therefore no
knowledge of object-oriented programming is required to get full
benefits of the library. As the development is done in a
collaborative and decentralized way; a comprehensive test suite has
been added to reduce the number of regressions when new features
are added or old problems are repaired. The software is very
modular and allows new classes to be added for handling other data
formats easily. FabIO and its source-code are freely available to
everyone on-line, licensed under the GNU General Public
License version 3 (GPLv3). FabIO is also available directly from
popular Linux distributions like Debian and Ubuntu.</p>
</div>
<div class="section" id="implementation">
<h3>Implementation<a class="headerlink" href="#implementation" title="Permalink to this headline">¶</a></h3>
<p>The main language used in the development of FabIO is Python;
however, some image formats are compressed and require
compression algorithms for reading and writing data. When such
algorithms could not be implemented efficiently using Python or
NumPy native modules were developed, in i.e. standard C code
callable from Python (sometimes generated using Cython).
This code has to be compiled for each computer architecture and
offers excellent performance. FabIO is only dependent on the NumPy
module and has extra features if two other optional Python modules
are available. For reading XML files (that are used in EDNA) the
Lxml module is required and the Python Image Library, PIL
is needed for producing a PIL image for displaying the image
in graphical user interfaces and several image-processing
operations that are not re-implemented in FabIO. A variety of
useful image processing is also available in the scipy.ndimage
module and in scikits-image.</p>
<p>Images can also be displayed in a convenient interactive manner
using matplotlib and an IPython shell , which
is mainly used for developing data analysis algorithms. Reading and
writing procedure of the various TIFF formats is based on the
TiffIO code from PyMCA.</p>
<p>In the Python shell, the <cite>fabio</cite> module must be imported prior to
reading an image in one of the supported file formats (see Table
<cite>Supported formats</cite>, hereafter).
The <cite>fabio.open</cite> function creates an instance of the
Python class <cite>fabioimage</cite>, from the name of a file. This instance,
named <cite>img</cite> hereafter, stores the image data in <cite>img.data</cite> as a 2D
NumPy array. Often the image file contains more information than
just the intensities of the pixels, e.g. information about how the
image is stored and the instrument parameters at the time of the
image acquisition, these metadata are usually stored in the file
header. Header information, are available in <cite>img.header</cite> as a
Python dictionary where keys are strings and values are usually
strings or numeric values.</p>
<p>Information in the header about the binary part of the image
(compression, endianness, shape) are interpreted however, other
metadata are exposed as they are recorded in the file. FabIO allows
the user to modify and, where possible, to save this information
(the table <cite>Supported formats</cite> summarizes writable formats).
Automatic translation
between file-formats, even if desirable, is sometimes impossible
because not all format have the capability to be extended with
additional metadata. Nevertheless FabIO is capable of converting
one image data-format into another by taking care of the numerical
specifics: for example float arrays are converted to integer arrays
if the output format only accepts integers.</p>
</div>
<div class="section" id="fabio-methods">
<h3>FabIO methods<a class="headerlink" href="#fabio-methods" title="Permalink to this headline">¶</a></h3>
<p>One strength of the implementation in an object oriented language
is the possibility to combine functions (or methods) together with
data appropriate for specific formats. In addition to the header
information and image data, every <cite>fabioimage</cite> instance (returned
by <cite>fabio.open</cite>) has methods inherited from <cite>fabioimage</cite> which
provide information about the image minimum, maximum and mean
values. In addition there are methods which return the file number,
name etc. Some of the most important methods are specific for
certain formats because the methods are related to how frames in a
sequence are handled; these methods are <cite>img.next()</cite>,
<cite>img.previous()</cite>, and <cite>img.getframe(n)</cite>. The behaviour of such
methods varies depending on the image format: for single-frame
format (like mar345), <cite>img.next()</cite> will return the image in next
file; for multi-frame format (like GE), <cite>img.next()</cite> will return
the next frame within the same file. For formats which are possibly
multi-framed like EDF, the behaviour depends on the actual number
of frames per file (accessible via the <cite>img.nframes</cite> attribute).</p>

<h2>Future and perspectives<a class="headerlink" href="#future-and-perspectives" title="Permalink to this headline">¶</a></h2>
<p>The Hierarchical Data Format version 5 (<cite>hdf5</cite>) is a data format which
is increasingly popular for storage of X-ray and neutron data. To
name a few facilities the synchrotron Soleil and the neutron
sources ISIS, SNS and SINQ already use HDF extensively through the
NeXus format. For now, mainly processed or curated data are
stored in this format but new detectors (Eiger from Dectris) are natively
saving data in HDF5. FabIO will rely on H5Py, which
already provides a good HDF5 binding for Python, as an external
dependency, to be able to read and write such HDF5 files.
This starts to be available in version 0.4.0.</p>
</div>
<div class="section" id="conclusion">
<h2>Conclusion<a class="headerlink" href="#conclusion" title="Permalink to this headline">¶</a></h2>
<p>FabIO gives an easy way to read and write 2D images when using the
Python computer language. It was originally developed for X-ray
diffraction data but now gives an easy way for scientists to access
and manipulate their data from a wide range of 2D X-ray detectors.
We welcome contributions to further improve the code and hope to
add more file formats in the future.</p>
