Description: Viewer for images produced by 2D X-ray detector
 FabIO is an I/O library for images produced by 2D X-ray detectors and
 written in Python. FabIO support images detectors from a dozen of
 companies (including Mar, Dectris, ADSC, Hamamatsu, Oxford, ...), for
 a total of 20 different file formats (like CBF, EDF, TIFF, ...) and
 offers an unified interface to their headers (as a Python dictionary)
 and datasets (as a numpy ndarray of integers or floats)
 .
