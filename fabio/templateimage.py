"""Template for FabIO image reader

This is a template for adding new file formats to FabIO

We hope it will be relatively easy to add new file formats to fabio in the
future.
The basic idea is the following:

1) inherit from FabioImage overriding the methods _readheader, read and optionally write.
   Name your new module XXXimage where XXX means something (eg tifimage).

2) readheader fills in a dictionary of "name":"value" pairs in self.header.
   No one expects to find anything much in there.

3) read fills in self.data with a numpy array holding the image.
   Some info are automatically exposed from data:
   * self.dim1 and self.dim2: the image dimensions,
   * self.bpp is the bytes per pixel
   * self.bytecode is the numpy.dtype.type of the data.

4) The member variables "_need_a_seek_to_read" and "_need_a_real_file" are there
   in case you have
   trouble with the transparent handling of bz2 and gz files.

5) Add your new module as an import into fabio.fabioformats.
   Your class will be registered automatically.

6) Fill out the magic numbers for your format in fabio.openimage if you know
   them (the characteristic first few bytes in the file)

7) Upload a testimage to the file release system and create a unittest testcase
   which opens an example of your new format, confirming the image has actually
   been read in successfully (eg check the mean, max, min and esd are all correct,
   perhaps orientation too)

8) Run pylint on your code and then please go clean it up. Have a go at mine
   while you are at it, before requesting a pull-request on github.

9) Bask in the warm glow of appreciation when someone unexpectedly learns they
   don't need to convert their data into another format
