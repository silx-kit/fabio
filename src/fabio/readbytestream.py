    Reads in a bytestream from a file (which may be a string indicating
    a filename, or an already opened file (should be "rb"))
    offset is the position (in bytes) where the pixel data start
    nbytespp = number of bytes per pixel
    type can be int or float (4 bytes pp) or double (8 bytes pp)
    signed: normally signed data 'y', but 'n' to try to get back the
    right numbers when unsigned data are converted to signed
    (python once had no unsigned numeric types.)
    swap, normally do not bother, but 'y' to swap bytes
    typeout is the numpy type to output, normally uint16,
    but more if overflows occurred
    x and y are the pixel dimensions
